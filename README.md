# hydjack
It's Django. It just got Hy. A django reusable app that makes it easy to make apps with Hy.

# Rationale
Because it sounds like fun.

While any Python library can be used by Hylang, and Django is not an exception, this reusable app acts as proof of concept that will allow Hy Society members to develop Django apps with Hy that doesn't feel like mental translation from Python to a Lisp. You know, `defmodel`, `defview`, `defcommand`, `defurl`, `defform`, `python manage.py hy_app hy_five`, `python manage.py defmodel hy_five <attribute_list>` etc? I would think that'd be fun!

# But there's ~~not much~~ NOTHING in it...
I know, I'll be working on that! I just learned the damn language! Which is awesome...
